# Javasip

Deployed app: https://tbiaglow.github.io/Javasip/

This app will first prompt the user for their bithday to confirm that they are of legal drinking age. The app will automatically search for local breweries using the user's location from their IP address. The user can also manually search by another location (as well as expand the radius of their search) by selecting "show map filter" and filling out the required fields.
